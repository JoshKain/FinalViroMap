              Before the Industrial Revolution took hold in Britain Manchester
              was nothing more than a market town, but has since has since
              become one the UKâ€™s leading and most innovative cities. It all
              began with the importation of cotton which was brought to
              Manchester from Liverpool via the Mersey and Irwell Navigation.
              This transformed the textile industry as well as Manchester.

            The Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) was founded in 1836 and the
            company began building its line between Manchester and Leeds in
            1837. Originally its line terminated at Manchester Oldham Road which
            opened on 3 July 1839. The company realised it would be advantageous
            to join its line to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR)
            creating a through route from Liverpool to Yorkshire with a joint
            station serving the centre of Manchester.{" "}

            Before 1755: The area was occupied by water-filled clay pits called
            the Daub Holes. The Lord of the Manor donated the site and the pits
            were replaced by a fine ornamental pond. 1914: After several years
            in which the Manchester Corporation tried to decide how to develop
            the site, it was left and made into the largest open green space in
            the city centre. The Manchester Public Free Library Reference
            Department was housed on the site for a number of years before the
            move to Manchester Central Library. The sunken garden was a remnant
            of the hospital's basement.{" "}
